# DIY Led Strip sync for keshav bhaiya pc(bais lighthing)
Bias lighting is a technique where lights are placed behind a TV or computer monitor, and shine at the wall. The result is not only a cool effect, but also reduced eye strain and a higher percieved contrast of the screen.
I had the idea to create a custom system using a Raspberry Pi, and RGB light strips. 
The final project used a Flask server, some custom circuitry my brother soldered for me, and a Raspberry Pi Zero W to listen for, and act on Google Home requests to change the colours of the lights.
